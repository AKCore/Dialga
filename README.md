# Starlight - BDSP Example 

This repo contains a barebones example of a Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl v1.0.0/v1.1.0 mod written (for the most part) in C++.
It is a fork of [Starlight](https://github.com/shadowninja108/Starlight), an awesome project geared toward mod creation for Splatoon 2.

The mod itself is an evolution randomizer mod used in [PointCrow's](https://youtube.com/PointCrow) video, found here:
[Pokemon Shining Pearl but they randomly evolve every level](https://youtu.be/5v7e4aLH3SA)

This tool is a fork of Brycewithfiveunderscores [Super Mario Odyssey Starlight Example](https://github.com/brycewithfiveunderscores/Starlight-SMO-Example), which has
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/brycewithfiveunderscores/Starlight-SMO-Example/pulls?q=label%3Ainitial-change+sort%3Acreated-asc) that details the changes made necessary to make Starlight work in SMO.
